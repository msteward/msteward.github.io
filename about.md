I'm a software engineer living in Vancouver B.C. Canada. I emigrated here in 2011 from the UK where I had been a consultant working in London. 

I'm passionate about web technology and have the fortune to work on some awesome projects using the latest tools at [Ensemble](http://www.ensemble.com). You can find out more about what I've done over on my [LinkedIn page](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/stewardm).
