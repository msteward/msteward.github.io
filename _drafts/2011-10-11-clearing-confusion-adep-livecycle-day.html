I’ve done a lot of explaining recently to others regarding the transition to ADEP from LiveCycle by Adobe earlier in the year.&nbsp; On the face of it there was a big change; the branding is new, the product names changed but underneath it’s still essentially the same albeit with some extra polish and some new features.&nbsp; <br />The basic formulae is <strong>ADEP = LiveCycle ES2 + CRX (Day)</strong><br />The move also brings together the old Solution Accelerators (which I’d never previously given a good look) as “Customer Experience Solutions” which are essentially pre-built applications built with ADEP which allow for rapid deployment rather than starting from scratch.&nbsp; <br />One of the other bigger changes is in the way ADEP is sold.&nbsp; It now comes in two flavours: Basic and Standard.&nbsp; A comparison chart can be found on the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/solutions/customer-experience/enterprise-platform/comparison.html" target="_blank">Adobe website</a> but essentially the difference is in the number of modules made available (Basic doesn’t include the Process Management module for example).&nbsp;
