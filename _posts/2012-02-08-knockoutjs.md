It’s been a hectic couple of months with my move to Canada but having now settled in I hope to be able to write a few more posts on some of the technology I’m working with.  My most recent project is HTML5 and JavaScript based which has introduced me to a new library – Knockout.js.

The reason for choosing Knockout was simple; we needed a library which could manage data binding and that could map from JS objects to JSON.  Knockout (plus the mapping plugin) filled those needs perfectly.  For those moving over from the world of data binding in Flex it will quickly feel familiar. 

Over the next couple of weeks I’ll be posting about some of the pitfalls we encountered whilst using the library and some tips on how to most effectively use it.  I’ll also be relating some of the concepts from ActionScript/Flex which should help others making the transition over to the HTML5 world.
