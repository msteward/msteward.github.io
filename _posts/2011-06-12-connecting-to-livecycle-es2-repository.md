When trying to test some forms I was struggling to remember the location of the LiveCycle repository. Â Turns out that you can access it via WebDav from Windows or directly from a browser using the following:  

{% highlight js %}
http://<server_name>:<port>/repository    
{% endhighlight %}

Login with your usual username and password and you'll be able to browse the repository hierarchy.
