I came across a problem recently when trying to debug my application after upgrading from Flash Player 9 (Debug version) to 10.2 (Debug version).  As soon as I upgraded my application stopped logging.  I searched everywhere and whilst I found a lot of people with the same problem never really found an answer.<br/><br/>After a lot of digging it appears to be the way you target the flash player version.  My application was targetting Flash Player 9 (in my flex-config.xml):<br/><br/>[code language="xml"]&lt;target-player&gt;9.0.124&lt;/target-player&gt;[/code]<br/><br/>Changing this to 10 started the trace logging again.  As I wanted to maintain the v9 target I've ended up reverting back to Flash Player 9 to get the logging working again.
