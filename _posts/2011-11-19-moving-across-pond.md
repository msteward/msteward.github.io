I've been a little quiet on my blog recently; moving from the UK to Canada took a little more of my time than anticipated! I'm now living in Vancouver, BC although in temporary accommodation until we secure an apartment.  As soon as I'm back up and connected properly I'll be starting a series of posts on my recent mobile development experience with some tips on getting started with Flash Builder 4.5 for mobile.
