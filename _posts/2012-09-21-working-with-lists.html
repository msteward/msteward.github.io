This is more a note to remind me in future but when dealing with lists in LiveCycle it can sometimes be a little tricky to just keep adding to a list without creating a loop. &nbsp;An easy way to do this within one set value step is to use the collection size to determine the index for adding something to the list. <br /><br />Here's an example XPath statement which will add to the end of the list (where "listAttachments" is your list variable):<br /><br /> <pre class="brush:js"><br />/process_data/listAttachments[number(get-collection-size(/process_data/listAttachments)+1)]<br /></pre>
