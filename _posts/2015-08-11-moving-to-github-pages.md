I've recently moved my blog over to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as I was finding Blogger too bloated for what I wanted. I was already very familiar with GitHub so the move was relatively straight forward and thanks to Jekyll and the [import tool for Blogger sites](http://import.jekyllrb.com/docs/blogger/).

Jekyll is a static website tool. What does this mean? Well for a start forget the back end; Jekyll generates your blog content from Markdown files into pre-formatted ready to serve HTML files. This means no back end databases, no server side scripting; just plain old HTML being served straight up. For some this would be too much of a limiting factor but for a simple blog like this it's perfect.
